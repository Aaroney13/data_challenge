# data_challenge
Code for my Meta data challenge pitch. This is a program for which I was selected as a finalist and given guidance by data scientists at Meta.
I first webscraped for the IMDB ratings and review counts for Netflix titles in Canada which can be found in webscrape.py
I then used this data to make simple visualizations found in Meta Data Challenge.py
Eventually I will upload my final pitch to my personal website so that it can be viewed
